# odin-recipes

This Odin Recipes project helped me solidify what I have learned in the Odin Project curriculum so far. I was able to learn the following:
* Organising and structuring of directories and files.
* Navigating directories and files with command shell.
* Working with git basics command such as `git add .`, `git commit`, and `git push`.
* Displaying images on the webpage.
* Linking different pages.

A lot of things I learned building the project, but will be keeping this README file short. Looking forward to learning more things with the Odin Project curriculum.
